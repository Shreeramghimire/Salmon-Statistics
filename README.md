# Probability Functions
## Random variable
A random variable is a numerical value assigned to the outcome of a random experiment or phenomenon.
1. A discrete random variable takes on a finite or countable number of possible values. The probability associated with each possible value is described by a Probability Mass Function (PMF), which assigns a probability to every individual outcome. In mathematical terms, probabilities are obtained by counting the occurrence of specific outcomes.
2. A continuous random variable can take any value within a given range or interval, resulting in infinitely many possible values. The probability distribution is described by a Probability Density Function (PDF). For continuous variables, probabilities are determined by calculating the area under the density curve over a given interval, rather than at a single point. This area represents the likelihood of the variable falling within that range of values.

## Cumulative Distribution Function (CDF)
The Cumulative Distribution Function (CDF) calculates the probability that a random variable is less than or equal to a specific value.
While individual probabilities tell the chance of a single outcome, the CDF gives the accumulated (running total) probability up to a certain point. 
The output is always between 0 and 1.

## One-Tailed Test Vs. Two-Tailed Test
### One-Tailed Test (The "Is it better?" Test)
One uses a one-tailed test when the research question is: "Is the new treatment strictly better (or strictly worse) than the old one?"

It is assumed to be completely confident that the effect cannot go in the opposite direction, or we simply don't care about the opposite direction. We pile your entire 5% alpha into just one tail of the distribution.
1. The Hypothesis: H0: New ≤ Old Vs. H1: New > Old (This is a "greater than" test)
2. Where does the rejection region go? : The entire 5% (α = 0.05) is put in the right tail only.
3. Confidence Interval: Crucially, a one-tail test gives us a one-sided confidence bound. Instead of 
±, we get either:
a. An upper bound: $\bar{x} + t_{0.05} \times SE$
